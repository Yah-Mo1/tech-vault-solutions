```bash

Scenario:

While working on Kubernetes cluster enhancements, you need to set up a recurring task that makes a call to a remote API. Which of the following commands is correct to perform this action?

Pick ONE option:

1. `kubectl run cronjob task --image=toolbox --schedule="*/1 * * * *" -- curl -s https://api.cyber-widget.com/refresh`

2. `kubecmd create periodic-task --image=toolbox --timing="/1 * * * *" -- curl -s https://api.cyber-widget.com/refresh`

3. `kubecmd run periodic task --image=toolbox --timing="*/1 * * * *" -- curl -s https://api.cyber-widget.com/refresh`

4. `kubectl create cronjob task --image=toolbox --schedule="*/1 * * * *" -- curl -s https://api.cyber-widget.com/refresh`

**Notes:**

- The correct answer will be evaluated on its ability to perform the task as described.

```

For this particular task, I opted not to engage in creating a YAML configuration file and testing it initially. Instead, I employed a process of elimination to narrow down the options. Since the challenge explicitly required setting up a recurring task rather than executing an existing one, I dismissed options 1 and 3. The key term "set up" guided my decision-making process. Consequently, I deduced that the viable options were 2 and 4.

Further investigation led me to understand that in Kubernetes, the establishment of an automated task typically involves the utilization of a CronJob. A CronJob operates by generating Jobs at specified intervals, facilitating repetitive tasks. For additional insights, I referred to the following resources:

1. https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/cron-jobs/
2. https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/job/automated-tasks-with-cron-jobs/

Considering all the information gathered, the ultimate choice is option 4. This selection involves the creation of the cronjob task, aligning with the established criteria and requirements of the task.
